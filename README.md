## SUMMARY:
What did you clean up?: I think the code was pretty clean before, but changed a few minor details to make it execute better 

Summary of function(s) added:
Uses the division of sine/cosine to calculate the tangent at every point from -360 to 360 and graph it on the same graph.

Summary of Feature Added:
Changes the color of the new tangent calculated graph from green to blue and rotates graphing the tangent graph while also regraphing the sine and cosine graphs in small incraments. The icon will quickly rotate between each function.
